LOADING ATARI ROM FILES

If you want to load rom image in your emulator, you
have to put your rom or cartridge files on your 
SD memory in the 'roms' directory. 
The .zip, .rom, .atr or .bin file extension 
are usable with the Atari 800-XE/XL Rom menu.
The .zip, .a52 file extension are usable with
the Atari 5200 Cartridge menu.

While inside Dingoo-Atari  emulator, just press
Select to enter in the emulator main menu, and then
using the file selector choose the rom or cartridge 
file to load in your emulator.

Back to the emulator window, the game should stard
automatically.

In the main emulator window you can only load Atari
800 roms and Atari 5200 cartridge ...  If you want 
to load other kind of roms or cartridge, please
use the "Original" Atari Menu menu 
(the white option in the emulator menu). 

Then select "Cartridge management" then "Insert
cartridge" and specify your disk image file, then

go back to the emulator using LTrigger.

CHEAT CODE (.CHT)
----------

You can use cheat codes with this emulator.  You can
add your own cheat codes in the cheat.txt file and
then import them in the cheat menu.  

All cheat codes you have specified for a game can be
save in a CHT file in 'cht' folder.  Those cheat
codes would then be automatically loaded when you
start the game.

The CHT file format is the following :
#
# Enable, Address, Value, Comment
#
1,36f,3,Cheat comment

Using the Cheat menu you can search for modified
bytes in RAM between current time and the last time
you saved the RAM. It might be very usefull to find
"poke" address by yourself, monitoring for example
life numbers.

To find a new "poke address" you can proceed as
follow :

Let's say you're playing Defend or Die and you want
to find the memory address where "number lives" is
stored.

. Start a new game 
. Enter in the cheat menu. 
. Choose Save Ram to save initial state of the memory. 
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
"Scan Old Value" field.
(for Defend or Die the initial lives number is 3)
. Go back to the game and loose a life.
. Enter in the cheat menu. 
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
"Scan New Value" field.
(for Defend or Die the lives number is now 2)
. In Add Cheat you have now one matching Address
(for Defend or Die it's 9E)
. Specify the Poke value you want (for example 3) 
and add a new cheat with this address / value.

The cheat is now activated in the cheat list and you
can save it using the "Save cheat" menu.

Let's enjoy your game with infinite life !!

LOADING KEY MAPPING FILES
------------

For given games, the default keyboard mapping
between Dingoo Keys and Atari keys, is not suitable,
and the game can't be played on Dingoo-Atari.

To overcome the issue, you can write your own
mapping file. Using notepad for example you can edit
a file with the .kbd extension and put it in the kbd
directory.

For the exact syntax of those mapping files, save
the keyboard settings inside the emulator and have a
look on file presents in the kbd directory
(default.kbd etc ...).

After writting such keyboard mapping file, you can
load them using the main menu inside the emulator.

If the keyboard filename is the same as the rom file
then when you load this rom file, the corresponding
keyboard file is automatically loaded !

You can now use the Keyboard menu and edit, load and
save your keyboard mapping files inside the
emulator. The Save option save the .kbd file in the
kbd directory using the "Game Name" as filename. The
game name is displayed on the right corner in the
emulator menu.


  Enjoy,

             Zx
